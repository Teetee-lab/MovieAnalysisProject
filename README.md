## Overview 

This project analyzes different types of movie titles that are currently doing the best at the box office and how they relate to Profit.

## Business Problem

In this project, I performed an exploratory data analysis on what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office and translated those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio could use to make a decision. 

## Conclusion

- My recommendation for Microsoft is to look into a production budget that correlates with a very high percentage of Return on Investment.

- When choosing genres for the movie, I will suggest that Microsoft look into the title with Average counts. 

- If Microsoft wishes to produce the best movies to make a higher profit they also need to look into the movie runtime.
  
- My Analysis shows that 69 percent of the total net profits across all genres come from just the top five  genres which are; Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi, Comedy, and Animation. I would recommend Microsoft focus on Action, Adventure, and Sci-Fi for high median net profits.


## Next Steps

- I would like to analyze the opening weekend box office gross and its correlation with profit. Also would look into how much of an impact does premiering of a movie has if the movie has a major box office release. In addition to that I would analyze the data for how movie producers select actors and directors for movies and studio performances and the theaters.
