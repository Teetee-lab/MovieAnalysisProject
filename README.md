## Overview 

This project analyze different types of movie titles that is currently doing the best at the box office and how it relates to Profit.

## Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and wanted to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don't know anything about creating movies. I need to explore what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office, and then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to make a decision. Below I will analyze the data given to understand different movies and their ratings and it's relationship to profits.

## Conclusion

- My recommendation for Microsoft is to look into production budget between 82million dollars and 91.2million dollars which correlates with a very high percentage of Return on Investment.

- When choosing genres for the movie, I will suggest for Microsoft to look into the title with Average counts. For example, if you look at Adventure and Action genres, they have more than average counts and that can yield to high profit and return on Investment.

- If Microsoft wishes to produce the best movies to make a higher profit they also need to look into the movie runtime. The average runtime for the top five genres is 102.00 minutes. This need to be considered when producing the movie.

- My Analysis shows that 69 percent of the total net profits across all genres come from just the top five  genres which are; Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi, comedy, Animation. I would recommend Microsoft to focus on Action, Adventure and Sci-Fi for high median net profits.


## Next Steps

- Analyze the opening weekend box office gross and it's correlation with profit.
- Look into how much of an impact does premiering a movie have if the movie have a major box office release.
- Analyze the data for producers in addition to actorsand directors.
- Analyze studio performance and the theaters
