## Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and wanted to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don't know anything about creating movies. I need to explore what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office, and then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to make a decision. Below I will analyze the data given to understand different movies and their ratings and it's relationship to profits.
